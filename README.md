# Video Duplicate Finder

## Overview

Video Duplicate Finder is a powerful desktop application that helps you identify and manage duplicate video files across your computer. Using advanced video signature analysis, this tool can detect near-identical videos based on content similarity, resolution, and duration.

## Features

- üîç Advanced Video Comparison
  - Detect duplicate videos using frame-level signature comparison
  - Configurable similarity threshold (50-100%)
  - Support for multiple video formats (mp4, avi, mkv, mov, wmv, flv)

- üìÇ Flexible Scanning
  - Drag and drop interface for adding files and folders
  - Recursive and non-recursive search options
  - Works with local file systems

- üóëÔ∏è Smart Duplicate Management
  - Multiple strategies for handling duplicates:
    - Keep both files
    - Keep largest resolution video
    - Keep smallest file size
    - Keep newest file
    - Keep oldest file
    - Manual selection

- üîí Safe Deletion
  - Automatic backup of duplicate files
  - Detailed action logging
  - Preview and confirm actions before deletion

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.7+
- PyQt5
- OpenCV (cv2)
- NumPy

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/video-duplicate-finder.git
   cd video-duplicate-finder
   ```

2. Install required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install PyQt5 opencv-python numpy
   ```

## Usage

1. Run the application:
   ```bash
   python video_duplicate_finder.py
   ```

2. Add files or folders:
   - Click "Add Files/Folders" or drag and drop
   - Configure similarity threshold
   - Choose recursive/non-recursive search

3. Start scanning
   - Click "Start Scanning"
   - Review duplicate groups
   - Select which files to keep or delete

## Detailed Workflow

1. **Video Analysis**
   - Scans video files
   - Extracts frame signatures
   - Groups videos by duration

2. **Similarity Comparison**
   - Compares video signatures
   - Identifies potential duplicates
   - Provides similarity percentage

3. **Duplicate Management**
   - Preview duplicate groups
   - Choose keep/delete actions
   - Backup duplicates before deletion

## Limitations

- Performance depends on the number and size of video files
- Requires moderate system resources for large video collections
- Works best with videos of similar content and encoding
